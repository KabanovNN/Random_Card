Simple app to add a little bit randomness and fun.  
You can create your own cards for example 'Pizza', assign a probability for example 10% and then, when you have enough you can pull one or a few cards and get a random result based on card's probabilites.  
You can create categories for you cards for example Food or Films. So no more time spent to deciding which film to watch, just add enough into collection and get a random film when you want to watch something. Don't forget to delete it afterwards ;)  
Also you can create and manage different profilies.
