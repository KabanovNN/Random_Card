Simple app to add a little bit randomness and fun into pretty structured life.  
You can create your own cards for example 'Pizza', assign a probability for example 10% and then, when you have enough cards you can get a random card based on card's probabilites.
So no more time spent to deciding which film to watch, just add enough into collection and get a random film when you want to watch something. Don't forget to delete it afterwards ;)
Manage folder, categories and cards using simple GUI.
